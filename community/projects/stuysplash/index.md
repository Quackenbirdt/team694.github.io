Stuy Splash is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight. Stuy Splash was originally adapted from the beta seminar that StuyPulse has given as a summary of beta testing for the past several years. We very much enjoy providing the beta seminar, but in 2012 we realized that we had much more information to impart to newer teams and as a result Stuy Splash was founded.

Modeled after the wildly successful CSplash and MIT Splash events, Stuy Splash is designed to aid newer teams in whatever area they are having trouble. A set of classes on a variety of topics from game-piece manipulators to marketing strategies to rationalizing your team's decision-making process are held throughout the day with multiple simultaneous classes and no requirement to sit through an entire lecture ensure that the learners are engaged in precisely what they want to learn about. And, of course, the beta seminar is offered as part of the day's lectures.

In 2012 it was held at the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn on December 15th.

In 2013, it was held at Stuyvesant High School on December 14th.
